    In July 2021, I joined the Visual Intelligence for Transportation Lab ([VITA](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/)), at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), 
    as a research assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi?lang=en). 
    At first, I conducted a literature review on **Human Pose Prediction** in which I studied the recently emerging networks **Transformers**.
    As a start, we participated in the Social Motion Forecasting challenge ([SoMoF](https://somof.stanford.edu/)), held by **Stanford University** and won the 3rd place.
    Our proposed method outperformed the baselines of the challenge by over 20% and got accepted in the ICCV workshops 2021. 
    After that we started to build a comprehensive library for Pose Prediction. I studied numerous different methods on pose prediction and gained a deep understanding of the topic. I also got proficient in Pytorch.
    The current library supports 8 famous datasets, and 10 models, all of which I have implemented.

    I joined the **Medical Imaging Analysis** group in Machine Learning Lab ([MLL](http://mll.ce.sharif.edu/)) as a research assistant under the supervision of 
    [Prof. Soleymani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S1U0KlgAAAAJ&hl=en).
    My project is **Weakly-Supervised Segmentation Using RNN-Based Registration**. A weakly-supervised method to label 2D slices of a 3D data, given a few labeled ones.
    I exploited superpixel-based pseudo-labels to enhance the effectiveness of unsupervised deformable registration.
    I designed and implemented a model combining LSTM and ConvLSTM and Unet to take advantage of the sequential information existed between consecutive slices.
    We have achieved better results up to 5% on abdominal datasets compared to state-of-the-art.

    In 2020, I joined the **Medical Image Analysis** group in Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Lab ([RIML](http://sharif.ir/~rohban/)) as a research assistant under the supervision of 
    [Prof. Rohban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=pRyJ6FkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
    My project was **Spatio-Temporal Segmentation of Myocardial Infarction**. We spent a lot of time clearing and registering our clinical data. 
    We used cardiac MRI for the deliniation of scar tissues in the myocardial region of the heart. I designed and implemented a model based on LSTM and Conv3D to solve this problem.
