    In July 2021, I joined the Visual Intelligence for Transportation Lab ([VITA](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/)), as an intern 
    under the supervision of [Prof. Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi?lang=en), at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). 
    At first, I conducted a literature review on **Human Pose Prediction** in which I studied the recently emerging networks **Transformers**.
    As a start, we participated in the Social Motion Forecasting challenge ([SoMoF](https://somof.stanford.edu/)), held by **Stanford University** and won the 3rd place.
    Our proposed method outperformed the baselines of the challenge by over 20% and got accepted in the ICCV workshops 2021. 
    After that we started to build a comprehensive library for Pose Prediction. I studied numerous different methods on pose prediction and gained a deep understanding of the topic. I also got proficient in Pytorch.
    The current library supports 8 famous datasets, and 10 models, all of which I have implemented.

    In 2020, I joined the **Medical Image Analysis** group in Robust and Interpretable Machine Learning Lab ([RIML](https://github.com/rohban-lab)) as a **research assistant** under the supervision of 
    [Prof. Rohban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=pRyJ6FkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
    My first major involvement with the team was on a research project aiming to classify **X-Ray** images into two groups of Normal and Abnormal. Regardless of the 
    undeniable value of this research, my most noteworthy research experience in Medical Image Analysis group 
    has been a project on **Dementia Disease**. In this project, I proposed a novel segmentation method which helped us to outperform the state-of-the-art 
    models.  The manuscipt is submitted to **MICCAI 2021**.

    [DataDays](http://datadays.sharif.edu/) was the **First National Data Scientific Competition** held 
    by the Sharif University of Technology.
    Its main goal was to broaden the appeal for working on problems related to data. 
    Moreover, it is a large-scale attempt to assess the level of knowledge in this field in Iran.
    
    As a volunteer, I joined the Assessment Staff and led a group of four people. We proposed questions which could be solved by Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods.
    In addition, we developed some [Perisan Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/datadays-content/datadays-content.github.io) as tutorials mostly related 
    to Data Analysis and Machine Learning. We made it accessible to all the teams in order to encourage them to raise their skill and knowledge in these fields. 
    
    The whole competition was centred around working on a dataset collected by [Cafebazaar](https://cafebazaar.ir/) from [Divar](http://divar.ir).
    This dataset mainly comprises online advertisements published by people in different categories.

    During summer of 2019, I worked for a start-up called [Yektanet](https://www.en.yektanet.com/), an online advertisement platform in my country. 
    This platform is basically publishing advertisements on well-known publishers for achieving clicks and views. 
    I was employed as a data science intern and developed algorithms to help advertisers **target new customers who are likely to be interested in their business** 
    using existing and innovative machine learning methods.

    In June 2018, I joined a start-up called [Pido](https://pidonet.com/en/home/), One of the largest Fuel Delivery companies in the Middle East. 
    I mainly worked on a project which was a collaboration between Pido and [PEC](https://en.pec.ir), a Payment Service Provider in Iran. In this 
    project, we developed a method to scan Persian and English debit cards and extract the necessary information. An API based on our method is now 
    deployed in both companies' applications. In this project, I proposed a novel method which is capable of removing the background of digits 
    for better Optical Character Recognition performance.
