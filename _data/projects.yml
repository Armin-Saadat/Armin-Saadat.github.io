    ## **IA-GCN: Interpretable Attention based Graph Convolutional Network for Disease prediction**
    
    ---
    
    **Interpretability** in **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)** has been explored to some extent in computer vision in general, yet, in the medical domain, it requires further examinations. 
    Moreover, most of the interpretability approaches for GCNs, especially in the **medical domain**, focus on interpreting the model in a post hoc fashion. 
    In this paper, we propose an interpretable graph learning based model which 1) interprets the **clinical relevance** of the input features towards the task, 2) uses the explanation to improve the model **performance** and, 3) learns a population level **latent graph** that may be used to interpret the cohortâ€™s behavior. 
    In a clinical scenario such a model can assist the clinical experts for better decision-making for diagnosis and treatment planning.

    ## **Dementia Severity Classification under Small Sample Size and Weak Supervision in Thick Slice MRI**
    
    ---
    
    Early detection of dementia through specific biomarkers in **MR images** plays a critical role in developing support strategies proactively. 
    **Fazekas scale** facilitates an accurate quantitative assessment of the severity of white matter lesions and hence the disease. Imaging Biomarkers of dementia are multiple and comprehensive documentation of them is time-consuming. Therefore, any effort to automatically extract these biomarkers will be of clinical value while reducing inter-rater discrepancies.
    To tackle this problem, we propose to classify the disease severity based on the Fazekas scale through the visual biomarkers, namely the **Periventricular White Matter (PVWM)** and the **Deep White Matter (DWM)** changes, in the real-world setting of **thick-slice MRI**. 
    Small training sample size and weak supervision in form of assigning severity labels to the whole MRI stack are among the main challenges. 
    To combat the mentioned issues, we have developed a deep learning pipeline that employs **self-supervised** representation learning, **multiple instance learning**, and appropriate **pre-processing** steps.
