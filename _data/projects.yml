    ## **Towards Human Pose Prediction using the Encoder-Decoder LSTM**
    
    ---
    
    **Human Pose Prediction** is defined as predicting the human keypoints locations for future frames, given the observed ones for past frames. 
    It has numerous applicationsin in various fields like **Autonomous Driving**. 
    This task can be seen as a fine-grained task while human bounding box and trajectory prediction deal with more coarse-grained information. 
    The former has been investigated less and here, we propose a **Recurrent Autoencoder Model** to do the harder task of pose prediction in the "Social Motion Forecasting" challenge conducted by **Stanford University**. 
    The results show the effectiveness of the our method by outperforming the available baselines by over 20% in evaluation metrics.

    ## **Spatio-Temporal Segmentation of Myocardial Infarction**
    
    ---
    
    Early detection of myocardial infarction through specific biomarkers in **cardiac MR images** plays a critical role in developing support strategies proactively. 
    We used cardiac MRI to segment scar tissues of heart causing possible future heart attacks.
    We achieved clean data from inconsistent **clinical data** using deformable registration techniques, including **Voxelmorph**.
    Then We combined LSTM with Conv3D to extract temporal features for infarction delineation.
    Currently we are exploiting **transformers** to achieve state-of-the-art results.
