    ## **Towards Human Pose Prediction using the Encoder-Decoder LSTM**
    
    ---
    
    **Human Pose Prediction** is defined as predicting the human keypoints locations for future frames, given the observed ones for past frames. 
    It has numerous applicationsin in various fields like **Autonomous Driving**. 
    This task can be seen as a fine-grained task while human bounding box and trajectory prediction deal with more coarse-grained information. 
    The former has been investigated less and here, we propose a **Recurrent Autoencoder Model** to do the harder task of pose prediction in the SoMoF challenge conducted by **Stanford University**. 
    The results show the effectiveness of the our method by outperforming the available baselines by over 20% in evaluation metrics.

    ## **Dementia Severity Classification under Small Sample Size and Weak Supervision in Thick Slice MRI**
    
    ---
    
    Early detection of dementia through specific biomarkers in **MR images** plays a critical role in developing support strategies proactively. 
    **Fazekas scale** facilitates an accurate quantitative assessment of the severity of white matter lesions and hence the disease. Imaging Biomarkers of dementia are multiple and comprehensive documentation of them is time-consuming. Therefore, any effort to automatically extract these biomarkers will be of clinical value while reducing inter-rater discrepancies.
    To tackle this problem, we propose to classify the disease severity based on the Fazekas scale through the visual biomarkers, namely the **Periventricular White Matter (PVWM)** and the **Deep White Matter (DWM)** changes, in the real-world setting of **thick-slice MRI**. 
    Small training sample size and weak supervision in form of assigning severity labels to the whole MRI stack are among the main challenges. 
    To combat the mentioned issues, we have developed a deep learning pipeline that employs **self-supervised** representation learning, **multiple instance learning**, and appropriate **pre-processing** steps.
